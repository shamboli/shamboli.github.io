I wanted to make a custom map sized between macro and micro for use in a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, but I wasn't really sure of a good tool to use to create one. There are tons of utilities available to create campaign maps on a macro scale, and tons to create smaller, micro scale maps which detail things such as rooms and furniture. 

I had some experience painting and laying out (poorly balanced) maps in StarCraft II, so I decided to give the SC2 Galaxy Editor a try to paint my idea of a map.

### Description: 
> The trail which the players can follow wraps around the forest, providing entrance to four sub-areas - the Maw, the Cave, the Clearing and the Castle (generic names). To the far east, the trail exits to a more arid zone. It looks like most of the traveling has been done through this entrance, yet the players are unlikely to enter from this side. Sand and dirt has been tracked onto the grass from the East entrance. Random encounters are certainly possible in this area, and the deeper that the players venture inside the more likely they would become. Since the area is cleared, animal encounters would less likely than a random Hobgoblin, Orc or Human patrol.


## The Maw:

</a>

### Description: 
> The Maw is a large, open area, set inside a ring of mountains, with two sloped ramps leading from the trail. Inside this area lay two pools of putrid green water, and a large, powerful being. This area seems very unnatural, as if the ground were shaped by some outside force. The dirt underneath seems non-existent, and is replaced by a dark grey ooze. The ooze is harmless to players, but was probably created by the creature who lives inside this area. The creature likely ventures out of this area (either by flying or by walking) to find food, so it's possible that there would be a patrol in the general area. It is unlikely that players would be able to see up the sloped ramp leading into the Maw, yet anything at the top of the ramp would have no issue seeing down into the trail.


## The Cave:

</a>

### Description: 
> The Cave is a general underground dungeon which lies beyond the Maw, the only way to get there is by walking past the entrance to the Maw. Along the path to the Cave, there lies a hidden cutaway with a sparse area of trees. The hidden path leads to an open area, approximately 20x20 which is intended for resting, since it's hidden out of sight. This area is filled with roots, dirt, rocks and a few skeletons with armor, and there is an patch in the clearing which looks like it's been used multiple times for a fire. It doesn't seem like anyone would randomly come into this area, but there's probably a chance that whatever creature dwells inside the Maw has come to find food here once or twice (up to the discretion of the DM).


## The Clearing: 
<a href="/includes/static/dire_maw/ClearingPath.jpg" data-lightbox="ClearingPath.jpg" data-title="Overview of the Clearing">
    <img src="/includes/thumbs/dire_maw/ClearingPath_tn.jpg" title="" />
</a>

### Description:
> The Clearing is a small forest dungeon which contains some type of very old, neutral being, that wishes no harm to the players. The entrance to the Clearing is visible along the trail leading to the front of the Castle, yet it might be difficult for the players to notice unless they are walking on the trail in the opposite direction. Random encounters in this area are certainly possible, but they would be very simple and easy for players to complete. The main goal of this dungeon is to put the players in contact with the being inside, who wishes to "cleanse" the evil from the forest. The being would know the history of the area (eg, how the Maw was created, who inhabits the Castle) and would be the main questgiver of the area.


## The Castle:

    <img src="/includes/thumbs/dire_maw/CastleRear_tn.jpg" title="" />
</a>

### Description:
> The Castle is a tricky dungeon. At first encountering the Castle, players may decide that they should enter from the back (if they notice it) instead of the front, yet the castle is designed for quite the opposite. Two natural bridges provide passage to both sides of the castle, and a river flows through a large organic moat. Most travel to the Castle occurs from the Eastern entrance of the map, into what is seemingly the rear entrance, so that side would likely be the most fortified. The front entrance is barricaded by a large towering double door, approximately 15 feet high. The Castle contains a large courtyard and stairs which lead to different areas inside, one the main and largest being the Tower of whoever occupies the castle. This can be a powerful Sorcerer, Wizard, Barbarian, or person who has made a deal with the creature living in the Maw. The Castle is staffed and protected by a small Hobgoblin or Orc force, commanded by the ruler of the Castle.
